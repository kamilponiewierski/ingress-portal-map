# ingress-portal-map

UPDATE:
Since IPST2 is no longer available this is useless unless you have saved your csv file.

Create a map of portals submitted to Ingress using data imported from IPST

This program will need .csv file, named "IPST.csv" imported from IPST2 in the same catalog as create_heatmap.py.
The result of it will be html file with all Your portals marked on it, map is centered on Poland right now, it will be changed.
